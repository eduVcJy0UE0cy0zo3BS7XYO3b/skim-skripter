Masha: The water is ready.
Nastya: My patience has ended!
Masha: Hold on~
Nastya: I don't want to wait, pour it faster.
Masha: No, we need to do this properly.
Nastya: Oh, these procedures of yours, cups the size of a cat's paw, watery tea... What's the point of all these bourgeois trinkets? Our honored ancestors drank tea from kettles and samovars!
Masha: Unfortunately, no one drunk the tea this way before. Tea was brought to the Moscow Tsardom from China in the mid-17th century and was initially accessible only to the upper classes. The first samovar in the Russian Empire is dated 1740. It was, by the way, made nearby, about 3 hours' drive from Yekaterinburg~
Nastya: That's all bourgeois science. I only believe in the cold and the summer whisper of their crowns. After lunch, they whisper to me all the Truths Of This World.
Masha: I sincerely believe that they will help you pass the exam~
Nastya: They are needed for the Truth Of This World. You are for the exams. The world will plunge into darkness, the Army Of The Immortal will tear to shreds everything living that stands in its way.
Nastya: If we disrupt this fragile balance.
Masha: ...
Masha: Okay. There will be a samovar. In a week, we'll gather in an interesting place near the Yeltsin Center. There will be a samovar and the Russian Spirit you like so much. But for now... The water is at the right temperature. Today we'll try raspberry tea~
Nastya:
